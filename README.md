# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Assignment: <br />

Create a simple application that can lively update a dashboard when a client application clicks on either the orange or blue button. The dashboard must show live updates of the number of clicks without polling the database and display a chart after 5 seconds is elapsed. The game can be reset when the page is refreshed. <br />

# Requirements: <br />
•	Front End: ReactJS, Typescript
•	Back End: Node.JS with Typescript preferred but you may use any language you are comfortable with
•	It is recommended to use AWS services, but you can also use any other cloud technologies that you are more comfortable with, however use of modern technologies is encouraged (i.e. GraphQL, Docker, etc)
•	Tips: You can create a free tier AWS account for this assignment; your code will be reviewed during the first round interview, so please include comments, documentation, unit tests etc. as you would normally do in a business project. 

# What we implement: 
BE use: NestJs with TypeScript <br />
Used socket.io to do the connection <br />

FE use: React with socket.io
